AWS offers two schema conversion solutions to make heterogeneous database migration predictable, fast, secure, and simple. Both options will automatically assess and convert the source database schema and a majority of the database code objects, including views, stored procedures, and fuctions, to a format compatible with the target database. Any objects that cannot be automatically converted are clearly marked as action items with prescriptive instruction on how to convert, so that they can be manually converted to complete the migration.
